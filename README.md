# Video-Control-Using-Hand-Gesture-
The project was inspired from the concept of “Leap Motion” technique. But it was too costly to use by common people. We tried to make it in a very simple way and budget friendly also. We used Arduino &amp; Ultrasonic Sensor and to perform actions on our computer we used Python pyautogui library. Ultrasonic Sensors were reading the distance between the monitor and our hands. Analyzing that it was generating an string as a output that which operation it should be done(ex – play, pause, forward, volume up, volume down etc) and The commands from Arduino were sent to the computer through serial port (USB). This data will be then read by python which is running on the computer and based on the read data an action will be performed.
